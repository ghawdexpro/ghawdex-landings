## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ Don't copy-paste AI content without editing (humanize it)
❌ Don't generate fake testimonials (create demo videos, replace with real ASAP)
❌ Don't over-rely on one tool (mix AI + real photos/videos)
❌ Don't forget to brand (add logo to everything)
❌ Don't skip Canva step (raw Midjourney images need text overlays)

---

## ✅ QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before publishing any AI content, check:

- [ ] Is it on-brand? (Ghawdex colors, tone, message)
- [ ] Is it Malta-specific? (local references, imagery)
- [ ] Is it accurate? (fact-check claims, especially stats)
- [ ] Is it natural? (doesn't sound robotic)
- [ ] Does it have clear CTA? (what should viewer do next)
- [ ] Is Ghawdex logo visible? (branding)
- [ ] Is it mobile-friendly? (80% of users on mobile)
- [ ] Would YOU click/engage with it? (be honest)

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Midjourney images look too AI-generated"
**Solution:**
- Add "photorealistic" to prompts

**Solution:**

- Mix with real videos of your team

### "Claude/ChatGPT content sounds generic"
**Solution:**
- Provide more context in prompts

- Add specific Malta references

### "Not getting enough leads from ads"
**Solutions:**
- Improve targeting (are you reaching homeowners?)
- Better ad creative (test 10+ variations)
- Stronger CTA (make it clearer what to do)
