## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: "Ads approved but not spending"
**Solutions:**
- Increase bid/budget (Facebook often needs €20+/day to spend consistently)
- Expand audience size (too narrow = limited delivery)
- Check ad relevance score (low score = limited delivery)

### Issue 2: "High cost per lead (>€100)"
**Solutions:**
- Test simpler lead forms (fewer fields)
- Improve ad creative (better hook, clearer value prop)
- Refine targeting (too broad or too narrow)
- A/B test landing pages

### Issue 3: "Leads are low quality"
**Solutions:**
- Add qualification question to lead form ("Do you own your home?")
- Adjust targeting (exclude renters, younger demographics)
- Increase price transparency in ads (filters out price shoppers)

### Issue 4: "Ads getting rejected"
**Solutions:**
- Review Facebook ad policies
- Avoid "before/after" claims without disclaimers
- Don't use "you" in images
- Avoid sensational language

### Issue 5: "Running out of content ideas"
**Solutions:**
- Repurpose top-performing content
- User-generated content (customer photos)
- Industry news commentary
- FAQ answers
- Seasonal content
