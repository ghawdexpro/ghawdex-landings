## 💡 GUIDING PRINCIPLES

### 1. Phase-Based Approach
**Don't skip phases.** Each phase builds on the previous. Jumping ahead leads to gaps.

### 2. Test, Learn, Optimize
**Nothing is perfect on day one.** Expect to iterate. A/B test everything.

### 3. Data-Driven Decisions
**Let data guide you,** not assumptions. Track everything, analyze regularly.

### 4. Customer-Centric Messaging
**Always ask:** "What's in it for the customer?" Lead with benefits, not features.

### 5. Consistency Over Perfection
**Better to post consistently** (even if imperfect) than wait for perfection and post rarely.

### 6. Speed is a Differentiator
**The 14-day installation promise is your superpower.** Lead with it in all messaging.

### 7. Local Focus
**You're Malta's solar expert.** Use local language, local imagery, local social proof.

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Skipping Phase 1** - Jumping straight to ads without brand foundation
❌ **Ignoring personas** - Creating generic content that resonates with no one
❌ **Poor tracking** - Launching campaigns without conversion tracking
❌ **Set and forget** - Ads need daily monitoring and optimization
❌ **Too much selling** - Follow 80/20 rule: 80% value, 20% sales content
❌ **Inconsistent posting** - Sporadic content kills momentum
❌ **Ignoring mobile** - 80% of users are on mobile—optimize for it
❌ **No clear CTA** - Every piece of content needs a next step
❌ **Trying all platforms at once** - Master Facebook/Instagram and Google first

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: How long until we see results?
**A:** Expect first leads within 1-2 weeks of launching ads (Week 9-10). Meaningful volume (50+ leads/month) typically by Month 2-3.

### Q: What if we have a tight budget?
**A:** Start with €10-20/day ad spend (€300-600/month). Focus on Facebook/Instagram only. DIY all content creation. See Budget Scenarios in RECOMMENDED_TOOLS.md.

### Q: Do we need to hire an agency?
**A:** Not necessarily. This roadmap is designed for in-house execution. Consider agency if: (1) No time for daily management, (2) Budget >€5,000/month, (3) Want faster scaling.

### Q: What if ads don't work immediately?
**A:** Normal. Expect 2-4 weeks of testing before finding winning formula. Budget for testing phase. See "Common Issues & Solutions" in EXECUTION_ROADMAP.md.

### Q: Can we skip Phase 1 and go straight to ads?
**A:** Not recommended. Ads without brand foundation, tracking, and content library = wasted budget. Phase 1 is only 2 weeks—invest the time.

### Q: How much time per week does this require?
**A:** Phase 1-3: 15-20 hours/week. Phase 4 (live campaigns): 10-15 hours/week ongoing.

### Q: What if we're already running some ads?
**A:** Great! Use this framework to optimize. Start with Phase 1 (fill foundation gaps), then jump to Phase 4 optimization sections.
